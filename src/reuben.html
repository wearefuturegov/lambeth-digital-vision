                        <p>Reuben logs on, creates a profile and schedules a video call with an Employment Adviser (Amy). She suggests a local group of Dads, to build his confidence. Reuben look at the revies, and messages the organiser of the local group to find out more.</p>

                        <p>Reuben uses the ‘get feedback’ function on the platform to submit his CV to a local volunteer for feedback. Two days later he receives feedback, and the opportunity to talk it through the feedback via video call.</p>
