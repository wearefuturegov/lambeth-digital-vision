She also selects “Get a into work” and “Find a doctor” from a list of services she might be interested in. She finds it easy to follow, and completes it all first go. She confirms the information the council already had about her, and adds additional information about her living situation.</p>

                        <p>She reads through the next steps and FAQs. She clicks on the “Get a Job” link the Service Bot has provided to get more information.</p>

                        <p>Sabrina and her family are looking to upsize, and decide to move to Lewisham. Sabrina messages the Service Bot knowing how much she will have to do to organise the move. It responds instantly to confirm her address, and then organises final payments. It suggests a number of services that could be useful, she selects “Move my furniture”, and is shown easy access links to moving companies.</p>

                        <p>A few hours later she opens an email with her final payments, and selects to set up a payment plan rather than pay all her outstanding bills at once. Her payment calendar notifies her of the additional payments.</p>

                        <p>Sabrina enters her new postal code, and allows her and her families information to be shared with Lewisham council to make the transition as smooth as possible.</p>
